## Game mechanics

In the game of Poker Dice, two players each roll a hand of five standard (cubical or d6) dice. The goal is to have the highest ranking hand. Hand ranks are as follows, from low to high.

0. Nothing
2. One pair
3. Two pair (but not a full house)
4. Three of a kind (without an accompanying pair)
5. Short straight (either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2, 3, 4, 5 or 3, 4, 5, 6 (other value irrelevant))
6. Straight (either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
7. Full house (three of a kind plus one pair)
8. Four of a kind (other value irrelevant)
9. Five of a kind

After the initial roll, each player may reroll *any of the dice* in their hand (whichever ones they choose). There are two rounds of rerolls and then the highest hand wins.
